# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The web-design page currently has several critical UX issues that negatively impact user experience and functionality. The hero section is not properly centered, location text is difficult to read against white backgrounds, the 4-card layout causes overflow issues, and there are JavaScript errors occurring on internal town pages that prevent proper navigation. This redesign will address these issues to create a more professional, accessible, and functional web-design showcase page.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a visitor to the web-design page, I want the hero section to be properly centered and visually appealing, so that I get a professional first impression of the web design services.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user visits the web-design page THEN the hero section SHALL be perfectly centered both horizontally and vertically
2. WHEN the page loads on different screen sizes THEN the hero content SHALL maintain proper centering and proportions
3. WHEN viewed on mobile devices THEN the hero section SHALL remain centered and readable without horizontal scrolling

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a potential client browsing locations, I want the location text to be clearly readable, so that I can easily identify service areas without straining my eyes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN location text is displayed over backgrounds THEN the text SHALL have sufficient contrast ratio (minimum 4.5:1) for accessibility
2. WHEN locations are shown against white backgrounds THEN the text SHALL use dark colors or have background overlays for readability
3. WHEN users hover over location items THEN the text SHALL remain clearly visible with appropriate contrast

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user viewing the service cards, I want them to display properly within the viewport, so that I can see all content without layout issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the 4 service cards are displayed THEN they SHALL fit within the viewport without causing horizontal overflow
2. WHEN viewed on tablet devices THEN the cards SHALL stack or resize appropriately to prevent spillover
3. WHEN viewed on mobile devices THEN the cards SHALL display in a single column layout without breaking the page structure
4. WHEN cards contain varying amounts of content THEN they SHALL maintain consistent heights and alignment

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user clicking on town/location pages, I want the navigation to work smoothly without JavaScript errors, so that I can access location-specific information reliably.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user clicks on any town/location link THEN the page SHALL navigate without throwing JavaScript errors
2. WHEN the town page loads THEN all DOM manipulation SHALL complete successfully without removeChild errors
3. WHEN users navigate between different town pages THEN the transitions SHALL be smooth and error-free
4. WHEN the page renders THEN all React components SHALL mount and unmount properly without DOM conflicts

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user reading content on town pages, I want the white and teal text to be easily readable, so that I can consume the information without visual strain.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN white text is displayed THEN it SHALL only appear over dark backgrounds with sufficient contrast
2. WHEN teal text is used THEN it SHALL meet WCAG AA accessibility standards for color contrast
3. WHEN text overlays images or colored backgrounds THEN readability SHALL be maintained through proper contrast or background treatments
4. WHEN users with visual impairments access the content THEN the text SHALL be accessible with screen readers and high contrast modes

### Requirement 6
