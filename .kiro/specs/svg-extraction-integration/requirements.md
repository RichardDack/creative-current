## Introduction

This feature involves extracting a specific SVG element from an existing HTML file (page.html) and integrating it into the Next.js homepage.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN adding to homepage THEN the system SHALL integrate the SVG component into the existing page structure
2. WHEN adding to homepage THEN the system SHALL position the SVG appropriately within the layout
3. WHEN adding to homepage THEN the system SHALL ensure the SVG is responsive and accessible

### Requirement 4

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN creating favicon THEN the system SHALL generate a clean SVG file suitable for favicon use
2. WHEN creating favicon THEN the system SHALL optimize the SVG for small sizes (16x16, 32x32 pixels)
3. WHEN creating favicon THEN the system SHALL place the favicon in the public directory
4. WHEN creating favicon THEN the system SHALL update the Next.js metadata to reference the new favicon
