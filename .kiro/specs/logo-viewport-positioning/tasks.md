# Implementation Plan

- [x] 1. Optimize SVG structure and positioning





  - Restructure the SVG to use relative positioning instead of fixed transforms
  - Optimize viewBox dimensions to minimize whitespace and improve scaling
  - Add proper accessibility attributes (title, desc, role, aria-label)
  - Convert absolute positioning to percentage-based coordinates within viewBox
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.2, 4.1, 4.2_



- [ ] 2. Create responsive Logo component
  - Build new LogoComponent with TypeScript interfaces for size and variant props
  - Implement CSS Module with responsive breakpoints and container queries
  - Add CSS custom properties for consistent scaling across viewport sizes
  - Create size variants (small, medium, large, responsive) with appropriate dimensions
  - _Requirements: 2.1, 2.2, 2.3, 3.1_

- [ ] 3. Implement responsive positioning system
  - Create CSS classes for different alignment options (left, center, right)
  - Implement container query-based scaling for context-aware responsiveness
  - Add flexbox/grid positioning utilities for reliable centering
  - Write media queries for mobile, tablet, and desktop breakpoints
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.3, 2.4, 3.2_

- [ ] 4. Add Framer Motion integration
  - Integrate smooth scaling transitions when logo size changes
  - Implement hover animations that respect reduced motion preferences
  - Add entrance animations for logo appearance
  - Create motion variants for different logo states (loading, hover, focus)
  - _Requirements: 4.4, 3.3, 3.4_

- [ ] 5. Create fallback and error handling
  - Implement text-based fallback for SVG loading failures
  - Add inline critical styles for logo visibility during CSS loading
  - Create default sizing behavior when container queries are unsupported



  - Write error boundary component for graceful logo failure handling
  - _Requirements: 4.1, 4.3_

- [ ] 6. Update Hero component integration
  - Replace current img tag with new LogoComponent in Hero.tsx
  - Update CSS classes to use new responsive logo system
  - Modify hover interaction to work with new component structure
  - Remove hardcoded width/height attributes in favor of responsive sizing
  - _Requirements: 2.1, 2.2, 3.1, 3.2_

- [ ] 7. Write comprehensive tests
  - Create unit tests for LogoComponent with different props and variants
  - Write integration tests for Hero component with new logo implementation
  - Add visual regression tests for logo appearance at all breakpoints
  - Implement accessibility tests for screen reader compatibility and ARIA attributes
  - _Requirements: 4.1, 4.2, 4.3_

- [ ] 8. Performance optimization and validation
  - Optimize SVG file size and rendering performance
  - Test logo loading and rendering on low-end devices
  - Validate cross-browser compatibility and consistent rendering
  - Measure and optimize first contentful paint impact of logo changes
  - _Requirements: 1.4, 2.4, 4.3_
