# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The website currently has fragmented navigation that creates a poor user experience across different pages and device sizes. The main issues include: disconnected pages (/web-design and town pages) that don't link back to the main site, hero navigation buttons that need restructuring to include web-design services, mobile burger menu that doesn't work properly on sub-pages, and the need for a persistent navigation solution that doesn't interfere with full-height showcases. This comprehensive navigation system will create a cohesive, intuitive navigation experience across all pages and device sizes.

2. WHEN the "ABOUT" button is clicked THEN the system SHALL scroll to the "meet our team" section
3. WHEN the "SERVICES" button is clicked THEN the system SHALL navigate to the /web-design page

5. WHEN users click any hero navigation button THEN the system SHALL provide smooth transitions to the target destination
