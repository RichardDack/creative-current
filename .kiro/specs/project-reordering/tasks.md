# Implementation Plan

- [x] 1. Prepare new project data structure





  - Create a complete WorkProject object with all required properties following the existing data format
  - Define appropriate project title, category, client, duration, and description
  - Set up image paths following the `/images/work/[project-name].png` convention
  - Include relevant technology tags that match the project's tech stack
  - _Requirements: 2.1, 2.2, 2.3_

- [x] 2. Update existing project IDs for sequential ordering





  - Modify "Insight Opticians" project ID from '2' to '3'
  - Modify "SaveOnThePen" project ID from '3' to '4'
  - Modify "Plodding Isles" project ID from '4' to '5'
  - Ensure CTA card retains ID 'cta' unchanged
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.2, 1.3_

- [ ] 3. Insert new project at position 2 in workProjects array




  - Add the new project object at array index 1 (position 2)
  - Assign ID '2' to the new project to maintain sequential numbering
  - Verify the new project follows the exact same object structure as existing projects
  - Ensure proper TypeScript formatting and indentation consistency
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.4, 5.1, 5.2_

- [ ] 4. Validate data integrity and export functionality
  - Test that featuredProjects array correctly excludes CTA and includes new project
  - Verify projectsByCategory object properly categorizes the new project
  - Confirm recentProjects array includes the new project
  - Check that projectStats calculations update correctly with new project count
  - _Requirements: 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, 4.1, 4.2, 4.3_

- [ ] 5. Verify TypeScript compliance and code quality
  - Ensure the modified file compiles without TypeScript errors
  - Confirm all WorkProject interface properties are correctly implemented
  - Validate that existing code formatting and structure standards are maintained
  - Test that all existing functionality remains unaffected by the changes
  - _Requirements: 5.1, 5.2, 5.3, 5.4_
