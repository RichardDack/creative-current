# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Creative Current logo SVG needs improved positioning and responsiveness to work better across different viewport sizes and contexts. Currently, the logo has fixed dimensions and positioning that may not scale appropriately or center properly in various layouts. This feature will enhance the logo's visual presentation and ensure it displays optimally across different screen sizes and container contexts.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a website visitor, I want the Creative Current logo to be properly positioned and scaled in the viewport, so that it looks professional and is clearly visible regardless of my screen size.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the logo is displayed THEN the system SHALL ensure it is properly centered within its container
2. WHEN the viewport size changes THEN the logo SHALL maintain appropriate proportions and positioning
3. WHEN the logo is viewed on mobile devices THEN it SHALL scale appropriately without being cut off or too small
4. WHEN the logo is viewed on desktop devices THEN it SHALL maintain crisp quality and appropriate size

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the logo SVG to have responsive dimensions and positioning, so that I can easily integrate it into different layout contexts without manual positioning adjustments.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the logo SVG is embedded in a container THEN it SHALL automatically adapt to the container's dimensions
2. WHEN the logo is used in different components THEN it SHALL maintain consistent visual hierarchy
3. WHEN the logo needs to be repositioned THEN the system SHALL use relative positioning rather than fixed coordinates
4. IF the container width is less than 500px THEN the logo SHALL scale down proportionally

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a designer, I want the logo elements (icon and text) to maintain proper alignment and spacing, so that the brand identity remains consistent across all viewport sizes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the logo scales THEN the text and icon elements SHALL maintain their relative positioning
2. WHEN the viewport is narrow THEN the logo elements SHALL remain readable and properly spaced
3. WHEN the logo is displayed THEN the "Creative Current" text SHALL remain prominently visible
4. WHEN the logo is displayed THEN the "Flowing Ideas Into Reality" tagline SHALL maintain appropriate secondary hierarchy

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user with accessibility needs, I want the logo to be properly structured for screen readers and have appropriate contrast, so that I can understand the brand identity regardless of my abilities.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN screen readers encounter the logo THEN the system SHALL provide appropriate alt text or title attributes
2. WHEN the logo is displayed THEN it SHALL maintain sufficient contrast ratios for accessibility compliance
3. WHEN users zoom the page THEN the logo SHALL remain legible and properly positioned
4. IF users have reduced motion preferences THEN the logo SHALL respect those settings
