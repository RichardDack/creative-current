# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature involves migrating a Framer-exported static website to a modern Next.js application. The original Framer site is a design agency template called "Agentic" with complex animations, custom styling, and responsive design. The migration will preserve all visual elements, animations, and functionality while converting to a maintainable React/Next.js codebase with improved performance and developer experience.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a website visitor, I want to experience the same visual design and animations as the original Framer site, so that the migration is seamless and maintains the intended user experience.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the migrated site loads THEN the visual design SHALL match the original Framer export exactly
2. WHEN animations trigger THEN they SHALL replicate the original spring physics and timing from Framer
3. WHEN viewing on different screen sizes THEN the responsive behavior SHALL match the original breakpoints (1200px/810px/390px)
4. WHEN interacting with elements THEN hover states and micro-interactions SHALL behave identically to the original

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want clean, maintainable React components with TypeScript, so that the codebase is scalable and easy to modify.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN examining the codebase THEN all components SHALL be written in TypeScript with proper type definitions
2. WHEN reviewing component structure THEN components SHALL follow the established architecture (global, sections, ui)
3. WHEN looking at styling THEN CSS SHALL use CSS Modules with design tokens for consistency
4. WHEN checking animations THEN Framer Motion SHALL be used with organized variant configurations

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a content manager, I want the ability to easily update content and assets, so that I can maintain the site without developer intervention.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN content needs updating THEN static data SHALL be organized in separate data files
2. WHEN images need changing THEN assets SHALL be optimized and properly referenced through Next.js Image component
3. WHEN text content changes THEN content SHALL be easily editable in dedicated data files
4. WHEN new sections are added THEN the component structure SHALL support easy extension

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a site owner, I want optimal performance and SEO, so that the site loads quickly and ranks well in search engines.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the site loads THEN it SHALL achieve better Core Web Vitals scores than the original Framer export
2. WHEN search engines crawl THEN proper meta tags and structured data SHALL be present
3. WHEN images load THEN they SHALL be optimized with Next.js Image component and proper formats (WebP/AVIF)
4. WHEN fonts load THEN they SHALL be optimized using next/font to prevent layout shift

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to preserve all original animations and interactions, so that the dynamic feel of the site is maintained.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN elements enter the viewport THEN scroll-triggered animations SHALL fire with the same timing as the original
2. WHEN the hero section loads THEN the slide-in animations SHALL match the original spring physics (stiffness: 200, damping: 30)
3. WHEN work cards are displayed THEN the stagger animation SHALL replicate the original 0.1s delay between items
4. WHEN hover interactions occur THEN scale and opacity changes SHALL match the original behavior

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a site administrator, I want the site to be deployable on Vercel's free tier, so that hosting costs are minimized while maintaining performance.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN deploying to Vercel THEN the build SHALL complete successfully within free tier limits
2. WHEN the site is live THEN it SHALL load within 2 seconds on average
3. WHEN checking bundle size THEN JavaScript bundles SHALL be optimized and code-split appropriately
4. WHEN monitoring usage THEN bandwidth and function execution SHALL stay within Vercel free tier limits

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to extract and convert all original design tokens and styling, so that the visual consistency is maintained and future updates are systematic.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN examining CSS custom properties THEN all original Framer tokens SHALL be converted to CSS variables
2. WHEN checking color usage THEN the primary color (rgb(49, 175, 180)) and all other brand colors SHALL be preserved exactly
3. WHEN reviewing typography THEN all font families (Inter Tight, Plus Jakarta Sans, Wix Madefor Display) SHALL be properly loaded
4. WHEN inspecting spacing THEN the original layout measurements and responsive behavior SHALL be maintained

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all SVG icons and graphics to be converted to React components, so that they are optimized and easily maintainable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN SVG icons are used THEN they SHALL be converted to React components with proper TypeScript interfaces
2. WHEN icons need styling THEN they SHALL accept color and size props for flexibility
3. WHEN examining the icon system THEN all icons SHALL be organized with barrel exports for easy importing
4. WHEN checking performance THEN SVG components SHALL be optimized and tree-shakeable

### Requirement 9

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive documentation and clear project structure, so that future maintenance and feature additions are straightforward.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN onboarding new developers THEN clear documentation SHALL exist for the project structure and conventions
2. WHEN adding new components THEN the established patterns SHALL be easy to follow and extend
3. WHEN modifying animations THEN the animation system SHALL be well-documented with examples
4. WHEN updating content THEN the data management approach SHALL be clearly documented
