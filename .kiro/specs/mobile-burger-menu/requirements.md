## Introduction

This feature adds a mobile-responsive burger menu to the website header that provides navigation functionality when the hero section's large navigation links are hidden on mobile devices. The burger menu will ensure users can access all navigation items (WORK, ABOUT, SERVICES, CONTACT) on smaller screens while maintaining the existing desktop experience.

## Requirements

2. WHEN the burger menu icon is clicked THEN the system SHALL open a full-screen or overlay navigation menu

5. WHEN the navigation menu is open THEN the system SHALL provide a close button or allow closing by clicking the burger icon again

3. WHEN hovering over navigation items THEN the system SHALL provide visual feedback through hover states
4. WHEN the burger icon is clicked THEN the system SHALL animate the icon transformation (hamburger to X)

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a desktop user, I want the burger menu to remain hidden, so that the existing hero navigation experience is preserved.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the viewport width is 768px or above THEN the system SHALL hide the burger menu icon
2. WHEN on desktop THEN the system SHALL maintain the existing hero navigation functionality
3. WHEN transitioning between mobile and desktop viewports THEN the system SHALL automatically show/hide the burger menu appropriately

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user with accessibility needs, I want the burger menu to be keyboard navigable and screen reader friendly, so that I can use the navigation regardless of my abilities.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN using keyboard navigation THEN the system SHALL allow opening the burger menu with Enter or Space
2. WHEN the menu is open THEN the system SHALL trap focus within the menu
3. WHEN using a screen reader THEN the system SHALL provide appropriate ARIA labels and roles
4. WHEN pressing Escape THEN the system SHALL close the burger menu
5. WHEN the menu opens THEN the system SHALL focus the first navigation item

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want the burger menu to integrate seamlessly with the existing design, so that it feels like a natural part of the website.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing the burger menu THEN the system SHALL use the same color scheme and typography as the existing header
2. WHEN the menu is open THEN the system SHALL maintain visual consistency with the site's design language
3. WHEN interacting with navigation items THEN the system SHALL use the same smooth scrolling behavior as the hero navigation
