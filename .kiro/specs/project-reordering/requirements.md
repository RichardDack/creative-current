# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature involves adding a new project entry to the work-projects.ts data file at position 2 (array index 1), which will shift all existing projects down by one position. The new project should follow the existing WorkProject interface structure and maintain consistency with the current project data format.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to add a new project at position 2 in the workProjects array, so that it appears as the second project in the portfolio while shifting existing projects down.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a new project is inserted at array index 1 THEN the system SHALL shift "Insight Opticians" from position 2 to position 3
2. WHEN the insertion occurs THEN the system SHALL shift "SaveOnThePen" from position 3 to position 4  
3. WHEN the insertion occurs THEN the system SHALL shift "Plodding Isles" from position 4 to position 5
4. WHEN the new project is added THEN the system SHALL maintain the CTA card at the end of the array

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the new project to follow the existing WorkProject interface structure, so that it integrates seamlessly with the existing codebase and UI components.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the new project is created THEN it SHALL include all required WorkProject properties (id, title, category, client, duration, image, thumbnail, description, link, tags)
2. WHEN the project is added THEN it SHALL use a unique id that doesn't conflict with existing project ids
3. WHEN the project data is defined THEN it SHALL follow the same data format and structure as existing projects
4. WHEN image paths are specified THEN they SHALL follow the existing naming convention (/images/work/project-name.png)

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the new project to be properly categorized and tagged, so that it works correctly with the existing filtering and categorization systems.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the new project is added THEN it SHALL include a valid category that either matches existing categories or creates a new logical category
2. WHEN tags are assigned THEN they SHALL be relevant technical tags that describe the project's technology stack and features
3. WHEN the project is categorized THEN the projectsByCategory object SHALL automatically include it in the appropriate category filter
4. WHEN the project is added THEN it SHALL be included in featuredProjects and recentProjects arrays (excluding CTA)

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the project statistics to automatically update, so that the portfolio metrics remain accurate after adding the new project.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the new project is added THEN the totalProjects count SHALL automatically increment by 1
2. WHEN a new category is introduced THEN the categories count SHALL update accordingly
3. WHEN the project is added THEN the totalClients count SHALL reflect the new project count
4. WHEN statistics are calculated THEN they SHALL exclude the CTA card from all counts

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to ensure the new project maintains the existing code quality and structure, so that the codebase remains maintainable and consistent.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the new project is added THEN it SHALL maintain the existing TypeScript typing and interface compliance
2. WHEN the project data is formatted THEN it SHALL follow the existing code formatting and indentation standards
3. WHEN the project is inserted THEN it SHALL not break any existing functionality or component rendering
4. WHEN the changes are made THEN they SHALL be compatible with the existing export structure and usage patterns
